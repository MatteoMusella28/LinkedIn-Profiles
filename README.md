LinkedIn Data Analysis: Machine Learning Regression for Job Positioning

Project Overview:
This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of 15,000 LinkedIn profiles. The dataset contains information 
such as work history, general personal details, and an analysis of profile pictures. The data will be utilized for studying and comparing 
various machine learning regression algorithms.
The primary goal of this project is to identify which features on a LinkedIn profile are most influential in securing a better job position. 
This will help determine whether such success can be predicted through a purely data-driven analysis of the characteristics recorded in the dataset.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from Kaggle, a subsidiary of Google, which provides datasets for educational purposes. You can access 
the dataset here: LinkedIn Dataset.
The dataset includes:
- General personal details (e.g., age, location)
- Professional work history
- Profile picture analysis
- Other relevant features associated with a LinkedIn profile

Objective:
The research aims to:
1. Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset to uncover key patterns.
2. Compare the performance of different machine learning regression algorithms to predict job positioning based on LinkedIn profile data.
3. Identify the most important features from LinkedIn profiles that are associated with improved job positions.

Regression Algorithms Implemented:
To compare the effectiveness of different machine learning approaches, the following regression algorithms were implemented:
- Linear Regression: A simple linear approach to model the relationship between the features and the target variable.
- Logistic Regression: Typically used for binary classification, applied here to predict the likelihood of securing a higher job position.
- KNeighbors Regressor: A non-parametric method that makes predictions based on the proximity of data points in the feature space.
- Decision Tree: A tree-based model that makes decisions based on the most informative splits in the data.
- Random Forest: An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and handle overfitting.
